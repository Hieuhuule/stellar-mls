There are no bridges to worry about on your short ride out to the Bay/Intracoastal Waterway. Soaring two story ceilings in the living room add a feeling of spaciousness and light. The kitchen is open to the dining and living room, and has white cabinets, granite counters and a trayed ceiling. The 2 bedrooms on the main level both have sliding glass doors to let natural light and breezes in. The Master BR overlooks the marina and waterfront. A spiral staircase leads to the second level which is roomy with a bedroom, full bath and sitting area or family room. An air conditioned storage area (11x26) can be\r\nfinished off for more living space. This townhouse gives you the privacy and spaciousness of a single family home with none of the worry.\r\nHarbour Towne is a gated Waterfront Community of 50, 2 and 3 bedroom condos. Amenities are a heated pool, hot tub, tennis/pickle ball\r\ncourt, clubhouse, covered picnic area with grills and private boat docks. The combination of being a short distance from the beach and the ability to have your boat in your backyard is unique and desirable. It's a winning decision!",

All quality materials used, it's sure to make the short list for buyers looking for that true downtown Winter Park atmosphere with brick paved roads & massively beautiful trees that align them. Location of this home puts everything DT Winter Park is known for just a short walk or bike ride away. Home is deeded as SFR-Townhome. A 6' fence is in place between the two homes along with other mature landscaping/trees to give each back yard tons of privacy and each unit has a yard large enough for a pool, playground set or for your beloved animals to play around in. Additionally there is NO HOA fee that you typically see with T.H.'s. Other unique features are private balconies off each bedroom, a Florida room that would make for a great office or third bedroom when guests come to visit. Lastly, just off the kitchen are a set of French doors leading to your wrap around - paved side patio so that you and your guest can enjoy the outdoors. This 1,777 SF home offers so much and still priced better than the competition!  Also great location for Rollins College student rental!",

All quality materials used, it's sure to make the short list for buyers looking for that true downtown Winter Park atmosphere with brick paved roads & massively beautiful trees that align them. Location of this home puts everything DT Winter Park is known for just a short walk or bike ride away. Home is deeded as SFR-Townhome. A 6' fence is in place between the two homes along with other mature landscaping/trees to give each back yard tons of privacy and each unit has a yard large enough for a pool, playground set or for your beloved animals to play around in. Additionally there is NO HOA fee that you typically see with T.H.'s. Other unique features are private balconies off each bedroom, a Florida room that would make for a great office or third bedroom when guests come to visit. Lastly, just off the kitchen are a set of French doors leading to your wrap around - paved side patio so that you and your guest can enjoy the outdoors. This 1,777 SF home offers so much and still priced better than the competition!  Also great location for Rollins College student rental!",

You will not find a better opportunity to build an extraordinary custom home on either 80’ of concrete seawall, or buy both and have 160 total feet of seawall.  Just think of the majestic home you could build on these two lots combined.  There are simply no other lots in this section of Punta Gorda Isles that affords the same opportunity to enjoy the most sought after west facing exposure in PGI.  Just a few minutes from downtown Punta Gorda and Fishermens Village, both with many fine restaurants and shops, this is the ideal location for your future home. You can jog, bike, or walk along the pathway that starts at Fishermen’s Village and connects for 3 miles along the Peace River, and 8 miles surrounding Punta Gorda. Punta Gorda has been voted one of the top 10 small towns in the country for boating and retirement, as well as runner up in a 2013 Rand McNally contest as most beautiful small town in the U.S - also recently written up as the 2nd safest city in the state of Florida. Come experience all that Punta Gorda offers - life simply couldn't be better to build your dream Florida home!

Property also has a Laundry room and work/storage shed in the back. Lake Iola is a private lake and is one of three ski-able lakes in Pasco county. Imagine coming home and being able to walk out your front door ready to ski, fish, kayak, paddle board, swim or just relax in your lounge chair soaking up the sun. Then in the evening enjoy a cocktail and watch the colorful sky as the sunsets on the lake.  All this, while your tenants pay your mortgage for you.",

The remainder of the property, 43.40 acres, is in pasture and capable of supporting 25-30 head of cattle.  There is a small amount of wetlands (+/- 5 acres) as indicated on the attached wetland map.  Quiet country living without being too far from local amenities.  This is an excellent deal and could be a showcase property in east Orange County.  A great opportunity for the right family.",

Sliding doors in the master and family room open to an expansive veranda with an upper level Jacuzzi elegantly cascading water down a waterfall into the pool below.  There is also an outdoor kitchen on the veranda. Steps lead to the new dock and lift for the boating enthusiast who wants immediate access to Gulf and Bay waters. The outdoor living space has breathtaking water and sunset views.  The upstairs living levels feature three guest suites and another terrace overlooking Big Pass and the Gulf of Mexico.

These water sources would provide all the water you would ever need for any type of farming operation.  The current farming operation consists of aspidistra and tree fern grown under oak hammock and saran shade cloth.  The 24 + acres of open space would be ideal for raising cattle or horses.  Wildlife, including deer, hogs, turkeys, also enjoy roaming this beautiful picturesque property.  Interested in raising hogs? There is also a 10 stall hog barn. Two metal barns (40’ x  60’ and 40’ x 80’) with electric and water available provide space for the many needs of an agricultural operation.  A former field office is also located near these buildings.  The beautiful majestic oaks would make a beautiful yard to build your new home in the peace and quiet of the country.  If you enjoy fishing and boating, this is a perfect location.  The St. Johns River is just a couple of miles away.  Entrance to the property has paved road frontage on Georgetown Shortcut Rd.",
